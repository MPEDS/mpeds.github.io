# MPEDS Annotation Interface (MAI)

This is the annotation interface used in creating datasets for the Machine-learning Protest Event Data System ([MPEDS](https://github.com/mpeds/mpeds)). While applied to the specific task of coding for protest events, this can also be used for the development of other types of event datasets. 

The MAI is available at [https://github.com/mpeds/mpeds-coder](https://github.com/mpeds/mpeds-coder).
